-----------------
## How it works?
1. Use 'with' expression to load the data text file.
2. read the file line by line, matching 3 regex to classify and capture the content.
3. The data will be stored in a dictionary type.

## Special Feature
* If a line is not well formatted, the program will print an error and continue to read.
* Regex capturing.

## Plan to add
* Run with the word guessing program, pick a word from the dictionary, if the using cannot get the word quickly, the program will display a usage guide to help memorize
* Add friendly GUI

## Sample run

```bash

➜  Assignment3 git:(master) ✗ python3 engHelper.py
Done!

```
